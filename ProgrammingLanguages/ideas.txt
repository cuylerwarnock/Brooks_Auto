have header class (for values XTMLK)

X is song index (for multiple songs in one file, an integer)

T is title of song (just a string)

M is time signature (4/4, 3/4, etc. Integer representations as 3/4 preferrable)

L is default length of a note, as a fraction of a whole note (1/4 for quarter)

K is the key of song (Amin, C or CMaj)

these headers dont belong in the tree. have a root variable to hold an entire song/file. no recursion (statementlist, statement, if statement). put these headers in a object variables in the parser class as opposed to making separate fiels
